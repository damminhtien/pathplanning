## Latest Handoff

Date: 2026-02-11
Author: AI Agent

### Scope Completed

1. Bumped package metadata to `0.1.2` in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Updated `README.md` release version.
3. Updated agentic operating files:
   - `agent.md`
   - `state.md`
   - `tasks.md`
   - `decisions.md`
   - `handoff.md`

### Validation Performed

1. Not run (documentation-only sync).

### Open Items

1. Continue strict naming/docstring normalization for remaining legacy modules outside current 3D RRT focus.
2. Decide whether to add an explicit `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes beyond agentic docs.
